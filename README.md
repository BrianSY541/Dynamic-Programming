# ECE 276B: Project 1 - Dynamic Programming

This repository contains the solution for Project 1 of ECE 276B: Planning & Learning in Robotics at UC San Diego. The project focuses on using dynamic programming to solve a navigation and object interaction problem in a "Door & Key" grid-world environment.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to implement a dynamic programming algorithm that enables an agent to find the optimal (lowest cost) path from a starting position to a goal position in a 2D grid environment. The environment may contain walls, a key, and a locked door. To reach the goal, the agent may need to pick up the key and use it to unlock the door.

This project is divided into two main parts:
* [cite_start]**Part A: Known Map** - The agent must find the optimal policy for several predefined environments where all details are known beforehand. 
* [cite_start]**Part B: Random Map** - The agent must derive a single, universal policy that is optimal for a set of 36 randomly generated 10x10 environments.  [cite_start]In these environments, the locations of the key and goal, and the status of the doors, are randomly chosen from a predefined set of possibilities. 

[cite_start]The solution formulates the problem as a finite deterministic Markov Decision Process (MDP)  [cite_start]and uses backward dynamic programming to find the optimal policy.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project requires Python and the libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git)
    cd your-repo/code
    ```
2.  Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Code

You can run the entire project, which will solve for both Part A and Part B and generate GIFs of the optimal trajectories, by executing the `doorkey.py` script:

```bash
python doorkey.py
```
The script will save the resulting GIFs in the plot/ directory.
